At time 8.00 A.M- Around 60kmph
At time 9.00 A.M- About 45kmph but at this time we know that it is the point of office and school timing in each state and country. So, no.of vehicles increase but the speed of vehicles decrease resulting in accumulation of vehicles at a certain junction and causing huge traffic issues.
Same situation stays till 4.00 P.M. And from 6.00 P.M to 9.00 P.M again the same situation

Below figure shows the two states:
