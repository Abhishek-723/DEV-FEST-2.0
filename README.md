## :pushpin: Our Pledge

### "Arrival at emergency without any dependency"

## :pushpin: Introduction

#### Setting up emergency points at each accumulated conjunctions to avoid the risk of line in both  the case of people driving on the road and the people who called for emergency .


##  :pushpin: Goals

* Life and Health above everything .
* Faster and efficient mode of connections between the patient and ambulances.
* Large scale initiatives will create  a huge amount  of job oppurtunities in solar panel making companies .


## Execution
### Detailed Structure
* Low cost emergency boards displaying the type of emergency vehicle(i.e., ambulance, police department vehicles and fire extinguishing vehicles)and the direction to turn at turns.
* Use of solar power to provide sun as a source of energy into the boards and run by solar energy.
* Efficient build up of solar panels for execution of maximum sunlight incident on the solar panel.
* Use of convex lenses(low cost) or right angled prisms(high cost) in order to build high-production of electricity through sunlight.
