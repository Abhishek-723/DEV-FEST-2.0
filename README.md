## :pushpin: Our Pledge

### "Arrival at emergency without any dependency"

## :pushpin: Introduction

#### Setting up emergency points at each accumulated conjunctions to avoid the risk of line in both  the case of people driving on the road and the people who called for emergency .


##  :pushpin: Goals

* __Project 2&#176;__ Life and Health above everything .
* In this Project __Team 2&#176;__ took into consideration __factors__ such as:
 
     * __Energy Supply__  
     * __Transport__
     * __Buildings and Industry__
     * __Population Growth__
     * __Economic Growth__
     * __Land and Industrial Emissions__
     * __Carbon Removal__

     along with various __sub-factors__ such as:

     * __Use of Coal__
     * __Renewable Resources__
     * __New Zero Concept__
     * __Carbon Price__
     * __Energy Efficiency__
     * __Afforestation__
     * __Use of Technology for Carbon Remomal__ , etc.
 
* __Team 2&#176;__ has also given insights about existing green technologies such as:
 
     * __FuelGems__
     * __Climeworks__
     * __Terramera__
     * __CarbonCure__
 
  which are working efficiently towards __Net-Zero Carbon__ , __Carbon Neutrality__ or simply __Carbon Removal__.

* __Team 2&#176;__ has used [En-ROADS](https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=21.8.0) to simulate the __optimal solution__ which is __practical__ and __achievable__. En-ROADS is a __transparent simulator__ developed by Climate Interactive, Ventana Systems, and __MIT__ Sloan and has been __calibrated against__ a wide range of existing __integrated__ assessment, __climate and energy models__.
